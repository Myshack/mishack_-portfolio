## 🧪 Sample Projects

### Bank Customer Churn Analysis

**Repo:** [Bank Churn Dashboard](https://github.com/your-username/bank-churn) 

**Summary:**

* Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze **bank customer churn**.

**Key Insights:**

* Customers with **low tenure (<2 years)** and **low balance** showed significantly higher churn rates.
* **Credit score <600** correlated with higher churn, especially when combined with multiple products.
* Female customers had slightly lower churn than males in this dataset.
* Geographic region played a major role, with one branch showing a churn rate **20% above average**.
* Suggested strategies: targeted retention campaigns for new customers, balance-linked loyalty incentives, and personalized outreach for high-risk segments.
